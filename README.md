# Sinnoh_Pokedex_Data_Visualisation

Final visualizations can be viewed at my profile on Tableau public:

# Objective

Create a visually appealing dashboard to illustrate the 151 Pokémon from the Pokémon Diamond and Pearl games.

# Dashboard Ideas:

1. Display all Pokémon information listed on the Pokédex (Number, Name, Type(s), and Stats).
2. Count the number of Pokémon in every type (Fire, Water, Grass, etc).
3. Create your own team by selecting 6 Pokémon to display on a graph.
4. Highlight the top ten Pokémon in every stat category (Hp, Atk, Def, etc).

# Overview

This project utilizes the PokéAPI, an open-source api, to fetch Pokémon data.

Using python, data is then cleaned, transformed, and exported as csv files to use in Tableau.

In Tableau, connect to the csv files, and start building your visualizations! I learned how to edit data sources, apply parameters and create calculated fields to enhance my graphs and dashboards.
